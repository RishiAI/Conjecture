📐 Conjecture: The Mathematician’s Playground
Conjecture is a next-generation platform built for pure and applied mathematicians, researchers, and students who need more than just a blank page. It’s a collaborative AI-powered environment designed to help you write, verify, visualize, and refine your mathematical ideas — from informal intuition to formal proof.

Whether you’re drafting a research paper, testing a new conjecture, or collaborating with colleagues across the world, Conjecture ensures your logic is sound, your visuals are clear, and your work is built on the foundations of centuries of mathematical thought.
